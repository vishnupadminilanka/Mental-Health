1. Performing the Calculations
Count the international students and find the summary statistics for each diagnostic test using aggregate functions. Round the averages to two decimal places and use the aliases min_phq, max_phq, and avg_phq.

2. Filter and group the data
You previously performed counts and average calculations on the data; now you need to apply the appropriate filter and group so that the calculations are done on the international student group only.

3. Ordering records
Order the resulting table in descending order of stay.
